# AI Infrastructure Agent Skills

> **⚠️ WARNING**
> This project is under active development and heavily generated by LLMs without strict proofreading. Use with caution and verify all code before production use.

A collection of specialized agent skills for AI infrastructure engineers, covering both technical development (GPU kernels, distributed training, inference optimization) and soft skills (flowchart creation, presentation design).

## Overview

This repository provides expert-level skills tailored for AI infrastructure engineering. Each skill packages domain knowledge, code examples, and best practices to transform Claude into a specialized assistant for specific frameworks and workflows—from writing high-performance CUDA kernels to creating professional technical presentations.

### Construction Methodology (Unless Otherwise Specified)

1. **Knowledge Gathering**: Use Gemini DeepResearch to collect comprehensive, up-to-date information on target frameworks
2. **Skill Development**: Transform research into structured skills using `skill-creator` in Claude Code
3. **Validation**: Test skill-generated code examples to ensure correctness
4. **Maintenance**: Regular updates based on latest official documentation
