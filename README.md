# AI Infrastructure Agent Skills

> **⚠️ WARNING**
> This project is under active development and heavily generated by LLMs without strict proofreading. Use with caution and verify all code before production use.

A collection of specialized agent skills for AI infrastructure development, enabling Claude Code to write, optimize, and debug high-performance systems.

## Overview

This repository provides expert-level skills for AI infrastructure engineering tasks. Each skill packages domain knowledge, code examples, and best practices to transform Claude into a specialized developer for specific frameworks and tools.

### Construction Methodology (Unless Otherwise Specified)

1. **Knowledge Gathering**: Use Gemini DeepResearch to collect comprehensive, up-to-date information on target frameworks
2. **Skill Development**: Transform research into structured skills using `skill-creator` in Claude Code
3. **Validation**: Test skill-generated code examples to ensure correctness
4. **Maintenance**: Regular updates based on latest official documentation

## Available Skills

### TileLang Developer
Write high-performance GPU kernels using TileLang for NVIDIA, AMD, and Ascend hardware.

**Capabilities:**
- Matrix multiplication (GEMM) kernels
- FlashAttention implementations
- DeepSeek MLA operators
- Performance optimization (swizzle layouts, pipelining, warp specialization)
- Cross-platform kernel development

**Status:** ✅ Complete

### Megatron Memory Estimator
Estimate GPU memory usage for Megatron-based MoE and dense models. Built upon [megatron_memory_estimator](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ISEEKYAN/megatron_memory_estimator).

**Capabilities:**
- Estimate memory from HuggingFace configs
- Support for MoE models (DeepSeek-V3, Qwen, etc.)
- Parallelism strategy comparison (TP/PP/EP/CP)
- Memory optimization recommendations

**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Planned Skills

### SGLang Developer
Development skill for SGLang (Structured Generation Language) runtime and optimization.

**Planned capabilities:**
- SGLang runtime configuration
- Custom sampling strategies
- Performance tuning for LLM inference
- Multi-GPU serving optimization

**Status:** 🚧 Planned

### vLLM Developer
Skill for vLLM engine development and deployment.

**Planned capabilities:**
- PagedAttention implementation
- Custom scheduler development
- Multi-LoRA serving
- Quantization integration

**Status:** 🚧 Planned

## Usage

### Installing Skills

Skills are installed by placing the skill directory in Claude's skills path:

**Natural Language:**
Ask Claude Code directly: "Help me install skills from https://github.com/yzlnew/infra-skills"

**Personal (across all projects):**
```bash
# Clone and copy to personal skills directory
git clone https://github.com/yzlnew/infra-skills.git
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r infra-skills/tilelang-developer ~/.claude/skills/tilelang-developer
```

**Project-level (for repository collaborators):**
```bash
# Clone and copy to project's skills directory
cd your-project
git clone https://github.com/yzlnew/infra-skills.git .claude/skills-repo
mkdir -p .claude/skills
cp -r .claude/skills-repo/tilelang-developer .claude/skills/tilelang-developer
```

Skills automatically activate when relevant tasks are detected.

### Example

```bash
# User request in Claude Code:
"Write a FP16 matrix multiplication kernel optimized for A100"

# Claude automatically loads tilelang-developer skill and generates:
# - Complete TileLang kernel code
# - Performance optimizations (swizzle, pipelining)
# - Testing code
# - Hardware-specific tuning recommendations
```

## Development

### Testing Skills

Validate code examples in skills:

```bash
# Run all tests from project root
pytest

# Run tests for specific skill
pytest tests/tilelang-developer/

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/tilelang-developer/test_gemm.py
```

### Updating Skills

When frameworks release major updates:

1. Update skill source files (SKILL.md, references/) with latest information
2. Run validation tests to ensure examples are correct
3. Commit and tag new version

## Quality Standards

All skills must meet these criteria:

- ✅ **Accurate**: Code examples must be tested and correct
- ✅ **Concise**: Follow progressive disclosure (SKILL.md < 500 lines)
- ✅ **Complete**: Include workflow, API reference, examples, and debugging
- ✅ **Current**: Based on latest stable framework version
- ✅ **Clear**: Explicit triggers in description for automatic activation

## Contributing
